# 🪶 Ol Chiki Transliterator

A fast and user-friendly tool to transliterate Santali text written in **Ol Chiki script** into **Latin** and **Devanagari (Hindi)** scripts. Built using Streamlit, this app helps you understand or convert Santali passages when reading Ol Chiki is still something you're learning.

## 🌱 Why I Built This

I’m currently working on a project called **Whisper ASR for Santali**, which aims to bring speech recognition to the Santali language using OpenAI’s Whisper model. But there was a personal challenge:  
I understand Santali, Hindi, and English — but I'm still learning to read and write Ol Chiki fluently.

That’s when this tool came to life.

It helps me:
- Read Santali passages written in Ol Chiki by seeing them in scripts I know well (Latin/Hindi)
- Prepare and proofread dataset materials for my ASR project
- Convert content for voice recording, subtitle generation, and more

## ✨ What This Tool Does

- 🔤 Transliterates Ol Chiki text into either:
  - Latin script (e.g., aak, ang, le, lo)
  - Devanagari script (for Hindi readers)
- 📋 One-click copy button beside output
- 💬 Optional feedback form to contact me
- 🚀 Very fast — even large blocks of text are converted in milliseconds
- 🔒 Email securely handled using `st.secrets`

## ⚠️ A Note on Accuracy

This tool works well in most cases, but:
- Santali is a rich and tonal language — and different speakers may write the same word in slightly different ways.
- So, while the accuracy is **pretty good**, it's not always 100% perfect.

Still, it’s a **very helpful companion** for many real-world tasks.

For example:  
> A Santali Wikipedian can use Google Translate to convert an English paragraph into Ol Chiki, paste it here to see the Latin or Hindi transliteration, then **proofread and edit it** before publishing it on the **Santali Wikipedia**.

It’s not about perfection — it’s about **making the process easier and faster**.
